dead project
============

yahoo just put internationalization controls into their own library.  this project no longer makes sense.





local-control
=============

Localization controls for React.JS, built on Yahoo!'s react-intl

-------------------

`local-control` is MIT licensed, because viral licenses and newspeak language modification are evil.  Free is ***only*** free when it's free for everyone.

Also because other people did most of the work.  `;)`
